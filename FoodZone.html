          <h5>Bacolod City is one of the top food destinations in the country. It is home to amazing dishes and, being the capital of Negros Occidental, <br> which is dubbed as the Sugarbowl
             of the Philippines, delectable sweets. But a food trip in the City  of Smiles won’t be complete if you don’t<br> get to try it’s most famous dish, the chicken inasal. So what is chicken inasal? The term inasal came from the Hiligaynon word asal,
             which means <br> skewed. So an inasal is anything skewered. At first, only the breast, thigh, and wing parts of the chicken were used. Eventually, the others parts <br> were also utilized. Unlike the usual marinade that’s made of soy sauce and calamansi, 
             an inasal uses a different kind. While the marinade ingredients <br> vary, I think the staples are calamansi, garlic, ginger, and sinamak or coconut vinegar.</h5>

         <h5>Piaya, or Piyaya, is a thin, flaky unleavened flatbread that envelops a sweet filling. This pressed pastry is a well-known delicacy<br> from Negros Occidental, specifically Bacolod, a place known for its vast sugarcane plantations. This is why the classic version<br> of this delectable treat has a thick muscovado filling.

            Nowadays, you will find a lot of filling varieties of this popular pastry, such as <br>ube halaya, mango jam, and chocolate. Some less-known ones are buko-pandan, strawberry, and calamansi-filled Piaya. There are even <br>artisanal Piaya, such as Oregano, Turmeric, and Basil Pesto, for those who prefer more organic flavors.</h5>
    <li><h3>Cansi</h3>

         <h5>Cansi (Kansi) recipe, a hearty and comforting Ilonggo sour soup with tender beef shanks, unripe jackfruit, batwan, and chilis made <br>extra tasty with annatto seeds. This flavorful soup is perfect for those gloomy, chilly days that would keep you toasty warm from head to toe!<br>

            Cansi or Kansi is a hearty beef soup popularly known for its tangy and fresh flavor that is known to have originated from Bacolod and is a staple <br> dish in the Ilocos region. This soup is normally made from broth of beef shanks with green jackfruit, chili peppers, and batuan (batwan). Similar to Bulalo,<br> because of the use of beef shanks and bone marrows. Meanwhile, Kansi has the same lip-smacking sour and tangy flavors much like Sinigang. The one unique <br>component is the use of green jackfruit as a vegetable or extender.</h5>
